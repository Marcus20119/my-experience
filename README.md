## Getting Started

To clone the My Experience Web and get started, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the codebase.
3. Run the following command to clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/Marcus20119/my-experience.git
```

1. Once the cloning process is complete, navigate into the cloned directory:

```
cd my-experience
```

1. Install the project dependencies using pnpm:

```
pnpm install
```

1. After the installation is finished, you can start the development server using the following command:

```
pnpm dev
```

This will start the development server and you will be able to access the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

To build the application for production, use the following command:

```
pnpm build
```

This will generate an optimized build of the application in the `build` directory.

Make sure you have pnpm installed on your system before running the above commands. If you don't have pnpm installed, you can install it globally by running:

```
npm install -g pnpm
```

Now you're ready to clone the source code, run the code, and build the Bespoke Solution Web using pnpm.
